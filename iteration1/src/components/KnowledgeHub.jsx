              <p>Effective meal planning helps prevent over-purchasing and ensures that you use up what you buy. By organizing your meals for the week, you can make the most of your ingredients and minimize waste. Remember to avoid shopping while hungry, as this can lead to impulse buys that may go to waste.</p>

              <h4>Proper Food Storage</h4>
              <p>Instead of discarding slightly wilted vegetables, find creative ways to use them, such as adding them to soups, sauces, or even hummus. You can also regrow certain vegetables like scallions, which ensures you always have fresh ingredients without needing to buy them repeatedly.</p>

              <h4>Support Local Farmers</h4>
              <p>An approach to reducing food waste involves sourcing directly from local farmers, often referred to as "farm-gate sourcing." This method not only ensures that you receive fresh produce that hasn't traveled long distances, but it also helps reduce waste at the source. Farmers can sell surplus or "imperfect" crops that might otherwise go unsold or be wasted. By purchasing directly from farmers, you help to minimize waste and support local agricultural communities.</p>

            <h4>Composting</h4>
            <p>If you do need to dispose of food, composting is a great way to keep food waste out of landfills. Starting a small compost bin at home can help turn food scraps into valuable fertilizer for your garden.</p>
